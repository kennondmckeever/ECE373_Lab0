# ECE373_Lab0
Cycles forward or backward through three PIC32 LEDs based on short or long presses. 

Kennon McKeever from group/team 9

In this project, the 3 LEDs on the PIC MCU will cycle forward with each unique short keypress (less than 2 seconds) and backward (bottom to top) with each unique long keypress.
